## Implementation and dependencies
This was written in Python 3.8.2 and requires the modules *math*, *random*, and *pygame*, all of which can be installed through pip if necessary.

## "Story"
Mount Shasta has erupted, and nobody was prepared for it. But not all is yet lost. You just happened to be nearby with your trusty Super Soakerâ„¢, and if you can cool Mount Shasta down before it incinerates you, you can save everyone.
